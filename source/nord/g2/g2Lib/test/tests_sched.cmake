# ---------------- SCH-4 - t0_frame_layout
#
# An ordinary executable, because SCH-4's acceptance criterion is a BUILD-time
# property: the four fully qualified function-pointer types in
# t0_frame_layout.cpp must fail to compile when any parameter is removed from
# any one of them, and a missing conversion overload must be a link error.
# Those two failures belong to the compiler and the linker. What remains for
# ctest is the behaviour -- the sign extension, the 24-bit mask, the slot count
# and the untouched registers -- and that is what the program checks when it
# runs.
